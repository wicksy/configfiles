### Configuration Files

Configuration files, mostly dotfiles, that I like to have wherever I work assuming I'll get a corporate Windows laptop and have to setup a Linux VM to
work effectively. Also handy if I move to a new laptop, trash my own devices, etc.

#### Installation

Best to clone the repo and then create symlinks from home directories to the repo (like my [laptop-build](https://github.com/wicksy/laptop-build) automation does)
